# AL Packages

AL Packages allows you to download symbols in 10 seconds of any Business Central version without having to connect to an online Sandbox or to an On-Premise environment.

It downloads necessary symbols (Base Application, Business Foundation, System Application, Application and System) and possible dependencies you have in the app.json of your project from Microsoft official artifacts repository, so this extension is always up to date.

This extension only has one command: AL: Download packages

Note: If you want to download a specific version, put it in your "application" key in your app.json, like: "application": "27.3.44313.44689"
